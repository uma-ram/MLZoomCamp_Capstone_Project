# Bank Marketing – Term Deposit Subscription Classification 

## Problem Description

Banks use marketing campaigns to promote term deposit subscriptions.
However, contacting all customers is costly and inefficient.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning classification
model that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit
based on demographic information, past interactions, and campaign data.

This model can help banks:
- Target high-probability customers
- Reduce marketing costs
- Improve campaign efficiency
